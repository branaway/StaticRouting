- Purpose:
  1. To improve the performance of the basic HTTP request processing pipeline in the Play! Framework. 

- Methodology
  1. It generate Java source code that maps the routing rules in the conf/routes file of Play! applications to statically linked controller methods calls, thus eliminating any reflection-based action invocations.

- Status
  The code tha translates the rules to Java source files are working. It has not been packaged as a module yet. The initial benchmark has shown about 100% throughput performance gain for a simple hello world type application.
